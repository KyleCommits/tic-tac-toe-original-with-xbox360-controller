# tic-tac-toe-original-with-xbox360-controller
I used Microsoft visual studio to code this project. 
I used a developer command prompt for compiling and testing the code. 
This program works on Windows only. 
Since I used Microsoft visual studio, there are a lot of libraries that are included in the compiler. 
One such library is the Xinput library. 
This library takes the inputs of the Xbox controller inputs and converts them to commands. 
Since this library is unique to Microsoft visual studio, it may not run on anyone elseï¿½s computer. 

My program is simple: play TIC TAC TOE against a random computer while using an Xbox controller to execute commands. 
You play it in the command prompt. When the player is done, he/she can exit the program via the in game options.
